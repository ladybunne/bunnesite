Ladybunne is a passionate gamer, community leader and all-around hobbyist creator. Both her namesake and avatar come from her FFXIV character, _Athena Laflamme_ - a tall, pink-haired bunny-woman with powerful arcane abilities and a signature air of confidence.

Ladybunne's background in game design, programming and classical piano lends her a broad skillset, a keen eye for detail and an appreciation for quality. A further videogame history featuring numerous roguelikes, platformers and speedrunning has sharpened her playstyle into one of quick-thinking, adaptability and calculated risk-taking.

Through her exposure to team-oriented environments, Ladybunne has grown into a confident, steadfast leader - capable of presenting a strong logistical front backed by a mixture of gentle patience and sharp, decisive intuition. She has led a number of raid teams throughout her time in FFXIV, and is always eager to rise to the challenges of leadership.

Ladybunne lives in Melbourne, Victoria, located in the southeast corner of Australia.
