It's a pretty cloudy Monday today. I had a property valuation this morning - a valuer came out to take some pictures of my apartment. I'm hoping this doesn't mean my landlord is intending to sell, because that would mean I'd have to move out, and I _really_ don't want to do that.

But it was otherwise painless! My vacuum broke about half an hour before the valuer arrived, which was a hassle. I'll have to see if I can put it back together at some point.

I've been thinking a lot about what sorts of things I want to write here. I've set myself two rules - be honest, and no deleting. That's hard, because I don't really want to leave a public trail of things that anyone can just come and learn about me... but, maybe I should be less afraid of that. I think the alternative is kind of sad - who wants to look back and see 30 years of deleted memories?

So, here I am. Trying to use this site to be a bit more outspoken about myself. I'm intentionally using this instead of, say, Twitter or another algorithm-riddled site. It's a bit more "pure", and less engineered to grab/hold attention. This is just me expressing myself... shouting into the void and seeing what happens.

I'll likely work on the format of this over time. I used to have a site that had both "posts" (long-form blog posts like this one) and "microposts" (like tweets but not on Twitter), and that worked well. I'll see if I get around to adding that functionality in.

Otherwise, we'll see how this whole site thing holds up. Fingers crossed it works out.
