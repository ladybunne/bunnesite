Hi again. It's been a little while. A busy week.

Here's a little run-down of how my various pursuits have been.

## Final Fantasy XIV

Things with all my various raid groups are going well enough. I have:

- **Pyretic**, my Savage static, who are just about BiS. No definite plans after that.
- **Blue Fire**, my serious BLU static, who have just cleared O8S and are now starting on O12S. They've cleared all the morbol raids, so O12S is their last "hard" fight before they're done!
- **Pilot Lights**, my casual BLU static. They're making good progress, surprisingly so for a less serious group, but unfortunately they got stuck on T13 today. Once they clear it they have A12S and A8S left.

I'm idly planning on doing some more work on solo Palace things eventually, as well as trying to hit Crystal in PvP. Neither are immediate goals.

[The Fire Place](https://discord.gg/thefireplace), the Materia hub community I run, is doing well - we're at almost 1700 members now. We've got a fun blue mage Crystal Tower event planned on the weekend, which should be fun. BA runs within the server have also been going well - nothing more than frag runs, but they're successful and generally fun enough to run.

Housing's being fixed in a week, I'm looking forward to having a large to play with again.

I've been really enjoying some of my glams lately, too. I'd like to get back to 3d modelling when I have time, but... who has time?

# Other games

I've finally stopped playing OSRS, for now. I really don't have time for a second MMO. It was fun, but also very tedious. I'll likely go back to it during a patch lull sometime.

...which brings me to my next point - I've been getting into Monster Hunter Rise with some close friends (whoops). It's been a very fun, enjoyable time. I'm having a lot of fun with the greatsword, which is a slow, super-powered weapon that requires a lot of precision and good timing. It's very punishing if you mess it up, so... in a way, that's good, too.

I'm playing through Outer Wilds (the best game ever) with my parents. Mum's making good progress with it, Dad's just about to leave Timber Hearth. It's been really fun and I'm looking forward to seeing how they both progress, especially how their runs diverge.

# Personal

I've got another housing inspection this Friday. Here's hoping nothing weird happens with it.

I also have some errands I've been putting off, mostly some paperwork I need to process and likely store somewhere. Truly, staying on top of everything is an impossible task.

Mood things have been fine, I suppose. Up and down, as is to be expected, but overall nothing too terrible.

I have a job interview that's sort of happening in the background. It's been long and drawn-out over weeks at this point, which is... not ideal, but it is what it is. It's for dev work, which would be nice to get back into. I'm somewhere between apathetic at More Job Stuff, and cautiously optimistic that it could actually be great. So it goes.

Hope your week's been good so far. Thanks for reading.
