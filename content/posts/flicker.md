_"...where once there burned a bright blaze, the pyre of a vibrant, empassioned soul, there now stood a faint flicker. The occasional glance revealed naught but a softly glowing coal... only observant eyes, watching, would spot a small surge, every so often._

_"This was what remained of her. Brought low by the adversities of life, drained of what used to make her crackle with warmth, with fierce devotion. An endless torrent of dampening oppression, progressively eroded at her fire, her very being._

_"She cried out, silently, as her essence was torn from her, reduced to nothing but embers, ash and steam. Her refusal meant nothing before the whims of those stifling influences. By now she was beyond saving._

_"As her fleeting life force drained, day by day, she reflected on days gone past, times when she was much more of herself. Those memories were all she had now._

_"...for a spent flame has no future."_
