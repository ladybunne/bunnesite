<p>All the words of a lifetime and it&rsquo;s impossible to pick the right ones. Hi.</p>
<p>In response to recent changes in my demeanour and behaviour as of late, a number of people have been increasingly asking me <em>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong&rdquo;</em>, or offering sentiments along the lines of <em>&ldquo;here if you need to talk&rdquo;</em>. It&rsquo;s emotionally difficult for me to respond to either, so I&rsquo;m writing here in the hopes that I can simply show people this, and have it speak for me. I&rsquo;ll try and keep it as brief as I can.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m not okay.</strong> I haven&rsquo;t been for a long time. If you&rsquo;re close to me you would have known some of the issues that have plagued me over the last few years, or even more specifically, during the first half of 2022. If not, it&rsquo;s not worth getting into. Things have gotten a lot worse as of late, escalating to a point where not a single day goes by without a lot of crying. I&rsquo;ve started withdrawing from everything and everyone&hellip; I just don&rsquo;t have the energy to put on a smile, these days.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>Time and time again I have been subject to abuse, harassment, heartbreak and manipulation, in my social endeavours this year, from so very many sources. An unfortunate side-effect of being a very visible, very public person in XIV circles, I suppose. I have thick skin, but everyone has their limits.</p>
<p>After everything that&rsquo;s happened to me this year, I&rsquo;ve had my hopes of happiness progressively eroded away. I&rsquo;ve rebuilt them after each setback, tried to pick myself up, but this time I have nothing left. I went into this year with a lot of optimism, and it&rsquo;s all gone. I&rsquo;ve been pushed to the point where I need therapy, soon, or there may not be much left of me before long.</p>
<p>We live in a world where marginalised groups have systemic violence committed against them on the daily. We are expected to live in spite of that. We are expected to tell our stories, to educate those around us, to bridge the gap between society&rsquo;s violence and society&rsquo;s curiosity. I am sick and tired of having to explain to the world what a &ldquo;transgender person&rdquo; is. I&rsquo;m tired of paying trans tax. Of the ensuing loneliness, the judgement, the double standards, the ever-ensuing onslaught of obstacles we&rsquo;re forced to overcome in order to simply <em>live.</em></p>
<p>Every day that goes by, I feel more and more like this world is one I was never meant to live in. It feels cruel, unyielding, ambivalent to people on the fringe. I&rsquo;m tired of having to wake up every day and battle through that, just to perpetuate an existence that causes me endless agony. Why would <em>anyone</em> continue to subject themselves to such a living? It&rsquo;s insanity.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-now">What Now?</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s not much anyone can do for me at this point. I&rsquo;m trying to find a therapist, but wait times for them are seeming infeasible. I&rsquo;m also trying to keep myself together, but I can feel things slipping, I can feel myself falling apart.</p>
<p>For once I don&rsquo;t have the answers here. I don&rsquo;t know what I need. I don&rsquo;t know how to solve these problems. Nothing scares me more.</p>
<p>If I could ask one thing&hellip; please try and build a better world for people like me, for people who are worse off than me, people who are less resilient than me. I don&rsquo;t think my story&rsquo;s going to have a happy ending - a person can only endure so much pain before they break.</p>
<p>I hope that those who come after me get to have happy endings to their stories.</p>
