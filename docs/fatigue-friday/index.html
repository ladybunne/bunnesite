    </header><p>May&rsquo;s been busy. It feels like it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to take a moment to myself and write these.</p>
<p>Between voting, inspections, cleaning, interviews and running everything I run, a lot of my energy has just been burned through. The rest of my time has been spent either trying to write code, which is an ordeal at times, or trying to invest in some self-care, which has had mixed results.</p>
<p>XIV&rsquo;s been a lot less fun lately. Outside of blue mage raiding I&rsquo;ve had little desire to log in. Everything feels a lot harder than it should. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like burnout, it just feels like the game is, currently, less enjoyable. I don&rsquo;t know how to feel about that.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m approaching the end of my time in Monster Hunter, for now at least. It&rsquo;s been really fun and I&rsquo;ve done pretty well, but myself and my friends are all getting a bit tired of it, too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been messing around with a game called Bitburner that&rsquo;s a fun combination of idle game and programming environment. You write scripts that (ideally) automate the boring parts of the game away, leaving you with an efficiency suite you can then iterate on and improve as you go. It is, at the very least, getting me to write more code, more often.</p>
<p>I feel pretty misunderstood a lot of the time, I think, even from some people I&rsquo;d consider close or friends at times. It&rsquo;s starting to wear me down.</p>
<p>Hopefully things are better by the next time I write a post. I might have a job by then.</p>
