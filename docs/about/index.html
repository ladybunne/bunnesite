    </header><p>Ladybunne is a passionate gamer, community leader and all-around hobbyist creator. Both her namesake and avatar come from her FFXIV character, <em>Athena Laflamme</em> - a tall, pink-haired bunny-woman with powerful arcane abilities and a signature air of confidence.</p>
<p>Ladybunne&rsquo;s background in game design, programming and classical piano lends her a broad skillset, a keen eye for detail and an appreciation for quality. A further videogame history featuring numerous roguelikes, platformers and speedrunning has sharpened her playstyle into one of quick-thinking, adaptability and calculated risk-taking.</p>
<p>Through her exposure to team-oriented environments, Ladybunne has grown into a confident, steadfast leader - capable of presenting a strong logistical front backed by a mixture of gentle patience and sharp, decisive intuition. She has led a number of raid teams throughout her time in FFXIV, and is always eager to rise to the challenges of leadership.</p>
<p>Ladybunne lives in Melbourne, Victoria, located in the southeast corner of Australia.</p>
