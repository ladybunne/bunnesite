    </header><p>Hi again. It&rsquo;s been a little while. A busy week.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a little run-down of how my various pursuits have been.</p>
<h2 id="final-fantasy-xiv">Final Fantasy XIV</h2>
<p>Things with all my various raid groups are going well enough. I have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pyretic</strong>, my Savage static, who are just about BiS. No definite plans after that.</li>
<li><strong>Blue Fire</strong>, my serious BLU static, who have just cleared O8S and are now starting on O12S. They&rsquo;ve cleared all the morbol raids, so O12S is their last &ldquo;hard&rdquo; fight before they&rsquo;re done!</li>
<li><strong>Pilot Lights</strong>, my casual BLU static. They&rsquo;re making good progress, surprisingly so for a less serious group, but unfortunately they got stuck on T13 today. Once they clear it they have A12S and A8S left.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m idly planning on doing some more work on solo Palace things eventually, as well as trying to hit Crystal in PvP. Neither are immediate goals.</p>
<p><a href="https://discord.gg/thefireplace">The Fire Place</a>, the Materia hub community I run, is doing well - we&rsquo;re at almost 1700 members now. We&rsquo;ve got a fun blue mage Crystal Tower event planned on the weekend, which should be fun. BA runs within the server have also been going well - nothing more than frag runs, but they&rsquo;re successful and generally fun enough to run.</p>
<p>Housing&rsquo;s being fixed in a week, I&rsquo;m looking forward to having a large to play with again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying some of my glams lately, too. I&rsquo;d like to get back to 3d modelling when I have time, but&hellip; who has time?</p>
<h1 id="other-games">Other games</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve finally stopped playing OSRS, for now. I really don&rsquo;t have time for a second MMO. It was fun, but also very tedious. I&rsquo;ll likely go back to it during a patch lull sometime.</p>
<p>&hellip;which brings me to my next point - I&rsquo;ve been getting into Monster Hunter Rise with some close friends (whoops). It&rsquo;s been a very fun, enjoyable time. I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun with the greatsword, which is a slow, super-powered weapon that requires a lot of precision and good timing. It&rsquo;s very punishing if you mess it up, so&hellip; in a way, that&rsquo;s good, too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing through Outer Wilds (the best game ever) with my parents. Mum&rsquo;s making good progress with it, Dad&rsquo;s just about to leave Timber Hearth. It&rsquo;s been really fun and I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how they both progress, especially how their runs diverge.</p>
<h1 id="personal">Personal</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got another housing inspection this Friday. Here&rsquo;s hoping nothing weird happens with it.</p>
<p>I also have some errands I&rsquo;ve been putting off, mostly some paperwork I need to process and likely store somewhere. Truly, staying on top of everything is an impossible task.</p>
<p>Mood things have been fine, I suppose. Up and down, as is to be expected, but overall nothing too terrible.</p>
<p>I have a job interview that&rsquo;s sort of happening in the background. It&rsquo;s been long and drawn-out over weeks at this point, which is&hellip; not ideal, but it is what it is. It&rsquo;s for dev work, which would be nice to get back into. I&rsquo;m somewhere between apathetic at More Job Stuff, and cautiously optimistic that it could actually be great. So it goes.</p>
<p>Hope your week&rsquo;s been good so far. Thanks for reading.</p>
