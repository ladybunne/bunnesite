    </header><p>It&rsquo;s a pretty cloudy Monday today. I had a property valuation this morning - a valuer came out to take some pictures of my apartment. I&rsquo;m hoping this doesn&rsquo;t mean my landlord is intending to sell, because that would mean I&rsquo;d have to move out, and I <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>But it was otherwise painless! My vacuum broke about half an hour before the valuer arrived, which was a hassle. I&rsquo;ll have to see if I can put it back together at some point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about what sorts of things I want to write here. I&rsquo;ve set myself two rules - be honest, and no deleting. That&rsquo;s hard, because I don&rsquo;t really want to leave a public trail of things that anyone can just come and learn about me&hellip; but, maybe I should be less afraid of that. I think the alternative is kind of sad - who wants to look back and see 30 years of deleted memories?</p>
<p>So, here I am. Trying to use this site to be a bit more outspoken about myself. I&rsquo;m intentionally using this instead of, say, Twitter or another algorithm-riddled site. It&rsquo;s a bit more &ldquo;pure&rdquo;, and less engineered to grab/hold attention. This is just me expressing myself&hellip; shouting into the void and seeing what happens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll likely work on the format of this over time. I used to have a site that had both &ldquo;posts&rdquo; (long-form blog posts like this one) and &ldquo;microposts&rdquo; (like tweets but not on Twitter), and that worked well. I&rsquo;ll see if I get around to adding that functionality in.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll see how this whole site thing holds up. Fingers crossed it works out.</p>
